//Stripping Names: Store a personâ€™s name, and include some whitespace characters at the beginning and 
//end of the name. Make sure you use each character combination, "\t" and "\n", at least once. 
//Print the name once, so the whitespace around the name is displayed. 
//Then print the name after striping the white spaces.
//console.log("Muhammad\tWaheed");
//console.log("Muhammad\nWaheed");
var fname = "Muhammad\tWaheed";
var fname1 = "Muhammad\nWaheed";
console.log(fname);
console.log(fname1);
